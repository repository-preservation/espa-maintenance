USGS Designation: EROS Science Processing Architecture (ESPA)

 System Overview
	The ESPA system is comprised of several types of nodes.  

	There is a user interface node, which must house a working Apache HTTPD server 
	with either mod_python or mod_wsgi installed, and must also have Django 1.3 installed.

	The database node must have a working copy of MySQL 5.x with a user defined 'espa'.

	The Hadoop Namenode and Hadoop TaskTracker nodes must have Apache Hadoop installed, naturally.

	Processing nodes must have Apache Hadoop installed as well as any science processing software,
	such as LEDAPS.

	The overall system flow is as follows.   
	A user request is submitted through the user interface whereby the request details 
	(requested scenes plus email address) are persisted to the database.  Prior to storing the requested
        scenes the bulk scene list is verified for basic sanity and cross referenced against the Long Term Archive's
        Inventory for Landsat scenes.  Users are notified via the user interface if there are invalid scene 
        identifiers in their order.
	
	Scenes newly stored in the database are marked with a status of "submitted".  A timed cron job interacts
        with the UI's xmlrpc service to then request all 'submitted' scenes be checked to see their current
        disposition: 1 - Not available and needing to be ordered (onorder) 2 - Available on cache and ready to 
        be processed (oncache) or 3 - Unable to process the scene due to it being a TMA instead of TM scene (unavailable).
        Scenes may also be marked unavailable if an unrecoverable error is encountered during processing, such as 
        nighttime scenes being requested or missing auxillary data as examples.

        Once this method completes, it returns to the cronjob via xmlrpc all the scenes that made it into oncache 
        status.  The cron job creates the Hadoop input file, stores the file in HDFS, updates the scenes' status 
        to 'queued', and finally starts the Hadoop job.

        Hadoop handles distributing individual requests to available cpu's at this point.  As a request is 
        pushed to a cpu, the individual job will update the scene status to "processing".  All requested
        processing is applied to the scene and the resulting output product is stored on the LSRD Online 
        Cache, which is a Lustre based system that augments the Landsat Online Cache.

        Hadoop handles cleaning up all processing node resources nomatter if the scene processed correctly or 
        not.  Thus as a part of the overall ESPA job, the processing chain will also store the processing log
        file to the database via xmlrpc ONLY in the event of a failure of some sort.  In this regard, no log 
        entry is a good log entry.

        The final step in processing is a completion email is sent out to the user once their order has been
        completed in totality.
